                                            Compound Finance released an update to change the price feed used by the Compound v2 protocol. Despite being <a href="/glossary#audit" target="_blank" class="define-target">audited</a> by three
                                            firms, no one caught a bug that caused all transactions for ETH borrowers and lenders to revert, effectively freezing the entire cETH market on the protocol. Because code changes require a
                                            seven-day-long vote, the change can't be reverted until a new proposal passes. In the meantime, users with positions they can't access will need to add collateral or repay loans carefully in order
                                            to avoid being liquidated if the price of ETH drops by the time the market is operational again.

                                            Faruk Fatih Özer, the CEO of the Thodex cryptocurrency exchange, swore that when they halted trading and shut off customers' access to accounts in April 2021, it was just to investigate suspicious
                                            activity. Then he disappeared, leaving behind a collapsed exchange and total losses estimated to be anywhere from $24&nbsp;million and $2.5&nbsp;billion in assets (depending who you ask). He left
                                            a statement in which he claimed that he was only on the lam in order to "work and repay my debts" to customers, after which he would turn himself in to Turkish authorities.
                                            <p>
                                                His plan to somehow work off anywhere from $24&nbsp;million to $2.5&nbsp;billion in debts was stymied when he was apprehended by Albanian authorities. He faces extradition to Turkey, where a
                                                prosecutor has asked for sentences of 40,564&nbsp;years for him and other executives (just in case, I guess).

                                            The Securities and Exchange Commission in Thailand took action against Samret Wajanasathian, the chief technology officer of the Thai crypto exchange Bitkub. The SEC fined him 8.5&nbsp;million
                                            baht (~$234,000), and said they would bar him from serving as a director or executive at any crypto firms for a year.
                                            <p>
                                                The SEC reported that Wajanasathian had purchased around $61,000 of Bitkub Coin ($KUB) just before it was publicized that the Siam Commercial Bank would purchase a 51% stake in Bitkub. After
                                                the announcement, the value of KUB rose 100%.

                                            <p>
                                                Earlier that week, the SCM had announced they would not be following through on purchasing the planned $500&nbsp;million stake in Bitkub, due to concerns over "various issues" that were raised
                                                by the Thai SEC.

                                            Crypto.com somehow managed to not only send a woman AUD$10.5&nbsp;million (US$7.2&nbsp;million) in May 2021, but not notice it for months afterwards. The woman had requested a $100 refund, but
                                            someone accidentally entered an account number into the refund amount section and granted this woman a sudden windfall.
                                            <p>
                                                Rather than contacting Crypto.com about the error, she put the money into a joint account shared with her sister, and purchased her sister a five-bedroom home with nearly US$1&nbsp;million of
                                                the funds.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Crypto.com only discovered the error in a December 2021 audit, and sued the woman for the erroneously-sent funds. She's just been ordered by the Victoria Supreme Court to sell the home and
                                                return the remaining money.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Unlike with many crypto transactions, erroneous transactions on centralized exchanges can typically be reversed by the exchange. However, Crypto.com would have had to notice the error much
                                                sooner, before the recipient transferred the funds elsewhere.

                                            the passport data of various Belarusian officials, including the country's authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko. Other passports include those of the head of the Belarusian KGB,
                                            Lukashenko's press secretary, and the country's prime minister.

                                                deploy any changes together. They also asked the Solana team to implement a two-step confirmation for such a potentially destructive command.

                                            Ragnarok is a <a href="/glossary#metaverse" target="_blank" class="define-target">metaverse</a> role-playing game that launched its character NFTs in April 2022. The project received
                                            $1.75&nbsp;million in seed funding, plus another $17.5&nbsp;million from NFT sales and royalties.
                                            <p>
                                                On August 26, CEO Fanfaron published a Substack post providing a breakdown of the project's finances, which he began by saying, "As a previous business owner, and because Ragnarok is a startup
                                                and not a DAO, our initial plan was never to operate our finances in public, which is why we have historically been closed and unwilling to share full accounting of our balance sheet." As the
                                                post went on, it became clear there might be other reasons they were reticent to publish it.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The post revealed that Fanfaron had lost $1.827&nbsp;million buying ETH during the crypto downturn: "I made mistakes by buying ETH multiple times when I thought it was an advantageous
                                                investment for the project, but then to protect downside risk and with the plan to reinvest at a better time, I sold our position in ETH, multiple times.."
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                It also revealed that the project is paying its team members apparently enormous salaries: $5.4&nbsp;million in team compensation, plus another $1.5&nbsp;million spent to buy out a co-founder.
                                                "We’re a scrappy startup," he wrote, after also acknowledging that he pays himself $50,000 a month ($600,000 a year)—a number he <i>already</i> reduced by $600,000 from his original salary of
                                                $1.2&nbsp;million per year. He ultimately promised in the post to pay back his trading losses.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                As for the game, well, it exists, which means it's already ahead of a lot of crypto games. They launched an alpha version of the game in late July after multiple delays, with Fanfaron
                                                explaining, "Our vision was to create something similar to WoW... we were, however, overeager and optimistic with regards to how much time it takes to create such a world." The alpha is a
                                                multiplayer pixel art world where characters can walk around and talk to each other, and interact with buildings. Battling, leveling, quests, missions, and breeding are apparently all yet to
                                                come.

                                            and is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, and Coinbase Ventures.

                                                According to the CEO, there's <i>nothing to worry about</i>, the search had nothing to do with money laundering (that's specific), and the agency only executed the search to learn more about
                                                its business model and user onboarding. Seems like a pretty weird way to do that, but what do I know.

                                                <i>TechCrunch</i>, however, reported that four people familiar with the investigation stated the investigation was to do with potential violations of foreign exchange laws, and that the agency
                                                suspects CoinSwitch acquired $200&nbsp;million in shares in violation of forex laws.

                                            Some people might be familiar with ENS, the "Ethereum Name Service", which seeks to be a web3 equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" target="_blank">DNS</a>. If
                                            you've seen people with usernames ending in <code>.eth</code>, that's an ENS address. The problem is that <code>.eth</code> is not a functional
                                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain" target="_blank">top-level domain</a>, and so many services relied on eth.link to surface these DNS records to other services.
                                            <p>
                                                However, the eth.link domain is only rented for a set period of time and needs to be renewed. ENS DAO tweeted that the domain's owner,
                                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_Griffith" target="_blank">Virgil Griffith</a>, is "unavailable". By this, they mean that he is currently serving his first of five years in prison
                                                for helping North Korea evade sanctions. With Griffith "unavailable", the project has found itself at the mercy of GoDaddy. Welcome to the decentralized web3 we've all been promised!

                                            <p>
                                                Although GoDaddy previously allowed another person to renew the domain on Griffith's behalf, they reversed that decision, and now say they intend to allow the domain to expire on September 5.

                                                The ENS DAO issued a series of tweets urging people to switch to a different service, given the risk that the domain could be snapped up. "If the name expires and is acquired by someone with
                                                ill intent, the damage they could do via phishing is substantial - so please update your links and alert your users of the issue immediately," they wrote.

The project received $1.75\u0026nbsp;million in seed funding, plus another $17.5\u0026nbsp;million from NFT sales and royalties.\u003cp\u003eOn August 26, CEO Fanfaron published a Substack post providing a breakdown of the project's finances, which he began by saying, \"As a previous business owner, and because Ragnarok is a startup and not a DAO, our initial plan was never to operate our finances in public, which is why we have historically been closed and unwilling to share full accounting of our balance sheet.\" As the post went on, it became clear there might be other reasons they were reticent to publish it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe post revealed that Fanfaron had lost $1.827\u0026nbsp;million buying ETH during the crypto downturn: \"I made mistakes by buying ETH multiple times when I thought it was an advantageous investment for the project, but then to protect downside risk and with the plan to reinvest at a better time, I sold our position in ETH, multiple times..\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt also revealed that the project is paying its team members apparently enormous salaries: $5.4\u0026nbsp;million in team compensation, plus another $1.5\u0026nbsp;million spent to buy out a co-founder. \"We’re a scrappy startup,\" he wrote, after also acknowledging that he pays himself $50,000 a month ($600,000 a year)—a number he \u003ci\u003ealready\u003c/i\u003e reduced by $600,000 from his original salary of $1.2\u0026nbsp;million per year. He ultimately promised in the post to pay back his trading losses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for the game, well, it exists, which means it's already ahead of a lot of crypto games. They launched an alpha version of the game in late July after multiple delays, with Fanfaron explaining, \"Our vision was to create something similar to WoW... we were, however, overeager and optimistic with regards to how much time it takes to create such a world.\" The alpha is a multiplayer pixel art world where characters can walk around and talk to each other, and interact with buildings. Battling, leveling, quests, missions, and breeding are apparently all yet to come.\u003c/p\u003e",
